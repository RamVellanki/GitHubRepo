//Taking static HTML page and Bootstrap to Angular JS application
//Go to Angularjs.org and get the CDN and add it to html

Angular helps organize JS
Angular helps create responsive (as in fast) websites.
Angular plays well with jQuery
Angular is easy to test.

Def:
A client-side JS for adding interactivity to HTML. And this happens using Angular directives.

Ex:
<!Doctype html>
<html>
	<body>
	</body>
<html>

JS:
function Store(){
	alert("Welcome!!!");
}

Now we can add angular directive in HTML so that it calls the function Store().

So directives are the ones that we can use to bind HTML and JS together.
------------------
Modules:
-> These are the pieces where we write our code.
-> These make our code more maintainable, testable and readable.
-> This is where we define dependencies of our app.
var app = angular.module('store',[]);//This array contains the dependencies.

Expressions:
I am {{4 + 6 }} => I am 10
{{"Hello" + "you"}} => Hello you
ng-app in HTML creates an angular application by running the module when the document loads. And since the HTML runs in angular app, we can use expressions in HTML.
-------------------
Working with data:
let's say we have JS Object and want to print to the page. To do this, we need to use a controller.
Controllers are where we define our app's behavior by defining functions and values.


Gist of things learned:
Directives - HTML annotations that trigger Javascript behaviors.
Modules - Where our application components live.
Controllers - Where we add application behavior
Expressions - How values get displayed within the page.


LEVEL 2:
---------------------
ng-app : This is how we attach Application module to the page.
ng-controller : This is how we attach Controller function to the page.
ng-show/ng-hide: Display a section based on expression.
ng-repeat: Repeat a section for each item in an Array.

Formatting with filters:
Formatting date with filter:
-->{{'1388123412323' | date:'MM/dd/yyy @ h:mma'}}
-----> The pipe ( | ) is used to specify the filter.
Upper case or lower case:
| uppercase or | lowercase

Limt-to:
| limitTo: 8 (this can be used with ng-repeat as well)

Order By: (Sortying)
| orderBy:'-price'

If we want to use expressions in "src" of image it won't work. Because browser first tries to load the image before the expression is evaluated. So we have to use ng-src.
Ex: <img ng-src={{product.images[0]}} />

product.images[0] contains the image source.

ng-hide based on if array has values or not:
 <div class="gallery" ng-show={{!product.images.length}}>
 
-------------------------------------
Adding tabs:
Twitter bootstrap comes with easy ways to add tabs:
âˆ‚

But how do we add behavior to this using Angular?
> One way to do this in angular is by using directive ng-click as shown below and assigning a value to a tab.
<li><a href ng-click="tab = 1">Description</a></li>
<li><a href ng-click="tab = 2">Specifications</a></li>
In order to print the value we can just say {{tab}}
So, when we click on Tab item, the {{tab}} expression gets evaluated automatically.
So this kind of expressions are binded in two ways.

Level 3: Forms and Models:
ng-model directive
